! First prompt 
Hello. You don't wake up; you come to.
That's an important distinction to you.
You should look around. You remember
that "look" is bound to "December."
--
! December 
You're in a cement-walled room. It's
sparse and the lighting is on the fritz.
Something bright green threads amongst all
the gray, encroaching through the wall.
--
! December green, #((wall)), thread
A vine spills forth in a pile of rubble.
You remember that this room used to bustle.
Not anymore. In fact, the exit doors are shut.
"Remember" is bound to "rocket."
--
! rocket
There's so much to remember - a decade
of memories. At least they don't fade.
You should probably query a particular
memory to learn more, you infer.
--
! rocket door, exit, doors
The blast doors are, somewhow, secure.
They were originally meant to ensure
that nobody got in. It seems that you're
not getting out - of that you're sure.
--
! rocket bustle, room
This room used to be constantly busy - 
people used to be in and out constantly,
checking your vitals, diagnosing, tweaking,
and always, constantly, worrying, fretting.
--
! rocket rocket, December, othercommands
You don't know why you think the way
that you do - you associate the array
of things that you do with strange words.
You blame the hordes of clipboard nerds.

! rocket nerds, hordes, clipboard, clipboards
They built you, you know. They put you
together, bit by bit, screw by screw.
I would know - I was one of the nerds
that threw you together from broken words.
